bio: Alex completed his MEng in Chemical Engineering at Imperial in 2025, graduating with First Class Honours. In his last year, he received the Roger Sargent Prize for his master’s thesis on the application of computers to the solution of chemical engineering problems, titled “Three-dimensional effects on carbon capture in wavy falling films.” Alex is currently a PhD candidate researching algorithmic design for generating chemical engineering process flowsheets automatically. By creating a method to generate reliable flowsheets automatically, it allows chemical engineers to screen different process alternatives more efficiently, and to optimise the selection and connection between different process operation units.
